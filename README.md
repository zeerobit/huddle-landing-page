## My process
- 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Boostrap v5.2
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
- This is my first solution using bootstrap and learned how to resize content and make my site responsive using bootstrap css grid combined with the different grid breakpoints


### Continued development
- Will build another more complex webpage with boostrap using more boostrap components such as navbar, dropdowns etc.. Then move on to Javascript next

### Useful resources

- [Bootsrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) - Used the bootstrap docs to search for some of the properties that i didn't remember
